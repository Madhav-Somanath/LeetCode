'''
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. 
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

# SOLUTION

def majorityElement(nums):
    
    count = 0
    candidate = None

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

    return candidate
